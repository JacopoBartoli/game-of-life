# Game of Life
The Game of Life is a grid sistem composed by cells which can assume a finite number of states. The state of each cell is determined by a set of rules applied to cells and their neighborhood.
t was devised by the British matematician John Horton Conway in 1970 as a simplification of the John von Neumann original idea to realize a cellular automaton that simulated a Turing machine.

# Rules
The original Conway's Game of Life is defined over a infinite grid of cells with only two states: alive or dead.
At each timestep the grid states is updated applying the following rules:
